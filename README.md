*A curated list of templates and resources which can be used as a starter pack for hackathon. This list aims to help starters as well as pros to get started with project development without wasting time on environment setup and package instalations.*

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework, pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as Sign in with Facebook authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

This list can help any dev save hours or even days of development time and can also serve as a learning guide for hackers.
